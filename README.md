##Original dataset url: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
##These data come from a group of 30 volunteers ages 19-48, who each performd 6 activities while wearing a smartphone
##The accelerometer and gyroscope in the phone captured linear acceleration and angular velocity data
##Run_analysis.R creates a dataset comprised only of the mean and standard deviation calculations for each variable
###It then provides an average calculation for each variable based on the subject and activity performed
