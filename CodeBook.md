##Data Origin
###https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
###Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) ###while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
##Variables
###The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and ###tGyro-XYZ (t denotes time).  
###The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ)
###The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
###(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the ###Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
###Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, ###fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
###The mean and standard deviation (std) signals were subsetted out to produce the final data set.
